//! Circuit execution engine (placeholder)
//!
//! This module will contain the execution logic for applying gates to quantum states.
//! The actual implementation will be completed in Phase 4.2 when gate application
//! APIs are finalized.

// Placeholder for future gate application logic
// TODO: Implement actual gate execution using simq-state APIs
